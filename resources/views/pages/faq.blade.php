<div class="p-text"><p>(Garage) (w.t) He's got the book, the old man's gone too. I'm locked in Biff's garage. (Lyon Estates) (v.o) You've gotta fly the DeLorean over here and get me the hell out of here. (cut to Garage) The address is 1809 Maple Street. (Lyon Estates)<br/>Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. (the car dies) No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. (the car starts. The alarm goes off and Marty floors it.) (Main Street) (Doc just manages to get the cables hooked up correctly as the Delorean comes rushing down the street. Just as he gets the cables together the lightening strikes and passes through the cable and he's thrown back.) Ahh. (In the Delorean)</p><br/>

<p>Doc, don't worry about it! Monday morning, 8 AM. We're gonna be gone, right? Theoretically, yes, but what if the train's late? Late? (Clara pops up at Doc's side.) We'll discuss this later.</p></div>
