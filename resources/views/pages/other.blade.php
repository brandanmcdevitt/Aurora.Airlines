<h2 class="pageTitle">Lorem Ipsum</h2>
<div class="p-text"><p>(Garage) (w.t) He's got the book, the old man's gone too. I'm locked in Biff's garage. (Lyon Estates) (v.o) You've gotta fly the DeLorean over here and get me the hell out of here. (cut to Garage) The address is 1809 Maple Street. (Lyon Estates)<br/>Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. (the car dies) No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. (the car starts. The alarm goes off and Marty floors it.) (Main Street) (Doc just manages to get the cables hooked up correctly as the Delorean comes rushing down the street. Just as he gets the cables together the lightening strikes and passes through the cable and he's thrown back.) Ahh. (In the Delorean)</p>

<p>Doc, don't worry about it! Monday morning, 8 AM. We're gonna be gone, right? Theoretically, yes, but what if the train's late? Late? (Clara pops up at Doc's side.) We'll discuss this later.</p></div>

<h2 class="pageTitle">Lorem Ipsum Two</h2>
<div class="p-text"><p>(o.s) There's a fight over here, come on guys! Talk about deja vu. Are you OK? (He helps Lorraine up and they walk hand in hand to the gym. A crowd, including 1955 Marty and the Wallet Guy has developed. 1955 Marty checks his photograph and runs off. 1985 Marty goes over to Biff once his parents and 1955 Marty have left.) OK everybody, let's back up now, huh, let's backup, just everybody back up. Give him a little bit of room, OK, a little bit of air. It's OK. I know CPR, (to Wallet Guy) I know CPR.</p>

<p>9... (Marty looks at everyone around him and each and every one of them returns the wide-eyed, silent gaze.) 10! You hear me, runt? I said that's ten, you gutless yella pie slinger. (shrugs) He's an asshole! I don't care what Tannen says! And I don't care what anybody else says either. (Just then Doc wakes up.)</p>

<p>Oh, he put his back out again. (She steps back to reveal George. He’s attached to a hovering device and is upside down.) How's Grandad's little pumpkin? How did you do that? How did he do that? Oh, out on the golf course. Are your folks home yet? I bought pizza for everyone. (She holds up the pizza, and it’s only a few inches long.)</p>

<p>Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. (The Dance) (Marty is up on stage with the Band playing the guitar. They're playing 'Earth Angel'.) This is for all you lovers out there. George, aren't you gonna kiss me?</p>

<p>(Kitchen Table) (talking to William) Hey, Will. So you're my great-grandfather...the first McFly born in America. (Raises Will up to see the baby peeing.) And you're peeing on me. (Hill Valley) (Marty is walking up the train tracks and he comes to the Train Station. He walks around town and we see lots of shots of Hill Valley in 1885.) Give me some soap, Frank.</p></div>

<h2 class="pageTitle">Lorem Ipsum Three</h2>
<div class="p-text"><p>Calvin. Why do you keep calling me Calvin? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Actually, people call me Marty. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. (she gets up and goes to sit next to him) Do you mind if I sit here? No, fine, no , good, fine, good.</p>

<p>Don't worry Marty, assuming we succeed in our mission this alternative 1985 will be changed back to the real 1985, instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie. Jennifer and Einie will be fine, and they will have absolutely no memory of this horrible place! Doc, what if we don't succeed? We must succeed! (Hill Valley – 1955) (The DeLorean arrives just outside of where they are beginning to build Lyon Estates. Doc and Marty get out of the car.)</p>

<p>(She sits down on the opposite bed.) Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Ah, where're my pants? (points) Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.</p></div>
